This page provides a transparent overview of what's currently implemented in Ddroelang and what's planned for future development.

## 🎯 Current Status (January 2025)

Ddroelang is actively developed with a focus on WebAssembly compilation and emerging native bytecode execution.

## ✅ Fully Implemented Features

### Core Language
- ✅ **Variables and Assignment** - Strong typing with `set variable which is type to value`
- ✅ **Data Types** - `int`, `decimal`, `text`, `flag`, `date`, `list of T`
- ✅ **Display Output** - `display` and `show` statements
- ✅ **String Operations** - Concatenation with `+` and interpolation with `[variable]`
- ✅ **Conditionals** - `when condition then ... end when` with `otherwise`
- ✅ **Loops** - `for each item in collection ... end for`
- ✅ **Comments** - Single-line `//` and multi-line `/* */`

### Modules and Actions
- ✅ **Module System** - `module name ... end module` with namespacing
- ✅ **Actions** - Parameterized functions with `action name with params gives type`
- ✅ **Return Values** - `give result` and `set variable from run module.action`

### Database DSL
- ✅ **Data Definitions** - `data Entity` with field annotations (`key`, `auto`, `required`, etc.)
- ✅ **HTTP Endpoints** - `serve get /path ... end serve` syntax
- ⚠️ **Database Operations** - Basic parsing implemented, runtime execution in progress

### Compilation Targets
- ✅ **WebAssembly** - Primary target, fully functional (`.droe` → `.wat` → `.wasm`)
- ✅ **Native Bytecode** - `@target droe` compiles to `.droebc` format
- ⚠️ **Rust Code Generation** - `@target rust` with Axum framework (experimental)

### CLI Tools
- ✅ **Project Initialization** - `droe init` creates project structure
- ✅ **Compilation** - `droe compile file.droe` to WebAssembly/bytecode
- ⚠️ **Runtime Execution** - `droe run` works for basic programs

## 🚧 Partially Implemented Features

### Database and HTTP Features
- ⚠️ **Database Runtime** - Parsing works, runtime execution in development
- ⚠️ **HTTP Server** - `serve` endpoints parse, DroeVM runtime needed
- ⚠️ **Multi-Database Support** - Architecture exists, drivers in progress

### Advanced Language Features
- ⚠️ **Complex Collections** - Basic list operations work, advanced manipulation pending
- ⚠️ **Include System** - File imports designed but needs testing
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** - Basic type checking, advanced error handling planned

### Build System
- ⚠️ **DroeVM Runtime** - Native bytecode interpreter under development
- ⚠️ **Release Builds** - `droe build --release` planned for single-binary output

## ❌ Not Yet Implemented

### Multi-Target Compilation
- ❌ **Python Target** - Not implemented (was documented but removed)
- ❌ **Java/Spring Boot** - Not implemented (was documented but removed)
- ❌ **JavaScript/Node.js** - Not implemented (was documented but removed)
- ❌ **Go/Fiber** - Not implemented (was documented but removed)

### UI and Mobile Features
- ❌ **UI Components** - `layout`, `form`, `input`, `button` etc. (parsing exists, no compilation)
- ❌ **Mobile Development** - No Android or iOS support
- ❌ **Cross-Platform UI** - Not implemented

### Advanced Features
- ❌ **Format Expressions** - `format date as "MM/dd/yyyy"` not implemented
- ❌ **Advanced HTTP Client** - `call "url" method GET` not implemented
- ❌ **Complex Database Queries** - Advanced query syntax not implemented
- ❌ **Package Management** - No module sharing system yet

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### Priority 1: Core Stability (Q1 2025)
- Complete DroeVM bytecode runtime
- Stable database operations
- HTTP endpoint handling
- Production-ready WebAssembly compilation

### Priority 2: Developer Experience (Q2 2025)
- Enhanced CLI tooling
- Better error messages
- Debugging support
- Performance optimization

### Priority 3: Language Expansion (Q3+ 2025)
- Format expressions
- HTTP client operations
- Advanced database features
- Package management system

## 💭 Future Considerations

The following features were documented but are not currently in active development:

- **Multi-Target Compilation** - May be reconsidered based on community demand
- **UI Framework** - Significant effort required, priority unclear
- **Mobile Development** - Would require substantial mobile expertise

## 🚀 How You Can Help

### Community Contributions
- **Testing** - Try Ddroelang with your use cases and report issues
- **Documentation** - Help improve examples and guides
- **Features** - Contribute implementations for partially completed features

### Feedback Priorities
We're particularly interested in feedback on:
1. WebAssembly compilation experience
2. Database DSL usability
3. Developer tool ergonomics
4. Performance characteristics

## 📋 Feature Status Legend

- ✅ **Fully Implemented** - Feature works as documented with tests
